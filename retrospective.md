## 🧠 Key Learnings
1.  **Complexity is a Debt**: Every "Smart" feature (RAG, Semantic Router) adds a failure point. In high-pressure engineering, **Cascading Fallbacks** beat **Complex Classification**.
2.  **Environment is Fragile**: Git commands can wipe logic faster than you can write it. The `start_all.bat` and `retrospective.md` are the ONLY permanent anchors.
3.  **Vendor Lock-in is Real**: AWS and Gemini can block you instantly. A multi-provider, multi-key rotational pool is the only way to guarantee 99.9% uptime on free tiers.
4.  **System-Prompt Governance is an SRE Primitive**: Without an enforced grounding message, downstream models produce inconsistent personas across cascade tiers. Ephemeral injection at the router layer is the cheapest, most reliable fix — zero extra latency, zero persistence overhead.
5.  **Measure Before You Optimize**: Compaction without telemetry is guessing. DuckDB-backed metrics on every request give you the hard data to prove token savings and justify architectural decisions.
6.  **Guard the Event Loop**: Never run blocking synchronous database or file system calls (like DuckDB file connections) inside an `async def` handler. In high-throughput ASGI environments like FastAPI, synchronous reads will freeze the event loop, causing severe latency spikes and connection resets (WinError 10054). Offload them to background threadpools using standard `def` endpoints.
7.  **Oracle / Self-Hosting Fallacy**: The overhead of managing an "Always Free" Oracle ARM server for fallback Ollama instances introduces immense maintenance burden and idle-reclamation risks. We explicitly rejected Oracle and completely stripped out local Ollama. Gemini's unprecedented rate limit reductions act as a massive wake-up call that validates this pure-cloud, multi-provider 9-tier router model.
8.  **Lifecycle Complexity Debt**: Embedding third-party asynchronous event loops (like `python-telegram-bot`'s webhook initializer) inside a primary ASGI server (FastAPI) creates fragile startup sequences that time out in serverless/containerized environments. Dropping the Telegram bot entirely in favor of a singular Web SPA drastically simplifies the architecture and guarantees instant server booting.

## 📜 Archived: The "Battle for Stability" (30+ Errors)

We have navigated through a dense minefield of infrastructure and API failures. Below is the list of the last 30 major errors and the "surgeries" performed to fix them.

### 🌩️ Cloud & Provider Failures (The "429/404" Cycle)
1. **Google 429 (Rate Limit)**: Gemini Flash hitting free-tier limits.
   - **FIX**: Implemented a **10-minute Circuit Breaker** and automatic failover.
2. **NVIDIA 404 (Model Not Found)**: Incorrect model identifiers for the new Llama 3.1 series.
   - **FIX**: Ran diagnostic scripts to verify the specific Meta IDs and updated `config.py`.
3. **NVIDIA API Timeout (30s)**: Free-tier endpoints becoming saturated and timing out.
   - **FIX**: Promoted **AWS Bedrock** to the Primary reasoning tier to bypass slow endpoints.
4. **Bedrock "Malformed Request"**: Older `invoke_model` payloads failing on Claude 3.
   - **FIX**: Migrated the entire cloud client to the official **Amazon Bedrock Converse API**.
5. **Gemini Truncation**: Responses cutting off mid-sentence.
   - **FIX**: Added explicit `generationConfig` with `maxOutputTokens: 4096`.
6. **Anthropic 401 (Invalid Key)**: Key missing or improperly loaded from secrets.
   - **FIX**: Standardized the `secrets/` loading logic in `config.py`.

### 🏠 Local & Infrastructure Failures (The "500/Memory" Cycle)
7. **Ollama 500 (Internal Server Error)**: Local embeddings failing due to memory pressure.
   - **FIX**: Fully decommissioned local embeddings; migrated to **Google Cloud Embeddings**.
8. **Local Latency (25s Response)**: Gemma 2 taking too long to generate text.
   - **FIX**: **Decommissioned all Local LLMs**; moved to a Pure Cloud architecture for speed.
9. **Ollama 404 (Model Not Found)**: Moondream or Gemma not being pulled in the background.
   - **FIX**: Added startup checks that verify model presence before booting the server.
10. **Local Truncation (128 Tokens)**: Ollama defaulting to short answers.
    - **FIX**: Manually set `num_predict: 4096` in the request payload.

### 🧠 Logic & Architecture Failures (The "Blind Router" Cycle)
11. **Semantic Cache Poisoning**: Old, short answers being served from memory.
    - **FIX**: Successive migrations from `v1` ➔ `v2` ➔ `v3` ➔ **`v4`** of the ChromaDB database.
12. **Blind Routing**: Router defaulting to "General" when embeddings failed.
    - **FIX**: Switched to **Google Embeddings** to ensure the router's "brain" is always online.
13. **Stateless Follow-ups**: "I don't know" answers because the model forgot history.
    - **FIX**: Increased history window to **5 messages** and added `Domain Persistence` logic.
14. **SyntaxError (f-string backslash)**: Code crashing on restart due to Python 3.10 limitations.
    - **FIX**: Refactored debug logging to move logic outside of f-string curly braces.
15. **Git Merge Conflicts**: Conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`) left in `router.py`.
    - **FIX**: Manually cleaned the source code to restore a clean production state.

### 📊 Current Status
The "errors" you see in the logs now are **External Outages** (Google 429s or NVIDIA Timeouts). Your code is now doing exactly what it was designed to do: **Survive them.**

When you see a log like `WARNING | router | Gemini failed... trying NVIDIA...`, that is **SUCCESS**. It means your code just prevented a total system crash.
