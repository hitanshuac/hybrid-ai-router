# Hugging Face Spaces Deployment Standards

To ensure zero-cost, permanent offsite availability, the Hybrid AI Router is deployed to Hugging Face (HF) Spaces. Any changes to the architecture, dependencies, or deployment pipeline MUST adhere to the following constraints to prevent regressions or build failures.

## 1. Network & Container Constraints
* **Port Binding:** HF Spaces routes external traffic strictly to port `7860`. The FastAPI server must bind to `0.0.0.0:7860`.
* **Privilege Level:** The Docker container must run as a non-root user (uid `1000`).
* **Workers:** Free tier Spaces only allocate 2 vCPUs and 16GB RAM. Run `uvicorn` with a single worker (`--workers 1`) to prevent OOM kills and CPU starvation.

## 2. Dependency Locking
* **httpx Version:** The `python-telegram-bot==20.8` library strictly requires `httpx~=0.26.0`. **Never upgrade** `httpx` to `>=0.27.0` in `requirements.txt`, as this causes unresolvable dependency conflicts during the Docker `pip install` step.

## 3. Telegram Integration
* **No Polling:** HF Spaces aggressively pauses/sleeps background threads. Standard Telegram polling (`bot.polling()`) will fail or be killed.
* **Webhook Mandate:** The Telegram bot must operate strictly in **Webhook Mode**. The webhook is registered during the FastAPI startup lifecycle (`init_webhook_bot`) and listens on the `/api/telegram/webhook` endpoint.

## 4. Deployment Mechanism
* **No Git Push:** Do **NOT** use `git push` directly to the Hugging Face remote to deploy. HF's pre-receive hooks strictly scan for binary blobs (e.g., SQLite/DuckDB databases, PyCaches). Because these files are generated at runtime locally, pushing `.git` history often triggers a rejection.
* **Use the SDK:** Always deploy using the custom `upload_to_hf.py` script. This script leverages the `huggingface_hub` Python SDK to upload a clean snapshot of the working directory, explicitly ignoring `.git/`, `data/`, `chroma_db_v2/`, `secrets/`, and all binary extensions.

## 5. UI Integration
* **Single Endpoint:** The Space exposes a single web port. Both the SRE Telemetry Dashboard and the Web Chat Console must be served on `/` via a unified, tabbed interface to maximize utility without requiring multi-container setups (which HF free tier does not support).
