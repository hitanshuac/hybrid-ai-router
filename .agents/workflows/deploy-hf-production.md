# HF Production Deployment Workflow

This workflow orchestrates the entire deployment pipeline. Every time the code is deployed to Hugging Face, these steps MUST be executed in order:

## Step 1: Pre-flight Verification & Rule Auditing
1. Read `.agents/rules/hf-deployment-standards.md` to ensure all execution requirements (webhook, port binding, memory limits) are met.
2. Read `requirements.txt` to verify that `httpx` is strictly configured within `~=0.26.0` range (to prevent version conflicts with `python-telegram-bot`).

## Step 2: Codebase-to-Document Synchronization
1. Analyze the updated codebase (`src/server.py`, `src/router.py`, etc.).
2. Synchronize API schemas, route definitions, and cascade rules across:
   - `docs/`
   - `.agents/rules/`
   - `.antigravity/conventions.md`
3. Update version designations in all files to the current release (e.g., `v3.0.0`).

## Step 3: Showcase & Flow Asset Updates
1. Ensure the system architecture showcase image (`docs/assets/architecture_diagram_v3_0_0.png`) represents the current cascade engine (10-Tier Cascade, SPA web client, webhook bot). If the version has changed, generate a new image and place it in the assets directory.
2. Verify that the Mermaid technical flow diagram in `README.md` is aligned with the codebase's cascading fallback logic.

## Step 4: Publish Showcase on GitHub (Call Sub-Workflow)
1. Run the `publish-showcase.md` workflow.
2. This will synthesize `retrospective.md`, `walkthrough.md`, and `implementation_plan.md` into `README.md`.
3. In `README.md`, ensure **both** the recruiter-facing static PNG and the technical Mermaid flow are visible:
   - Recruiter Showcase: `![Architecture Diagram](docs/assets/architecture_diagram_v3_0_0.png)` at the top of the file.
   - Technical Flowchart: Mermaid diagram in the interaction section.
4. Stage, commit, and push all modifications to GitHub first.

## Step 5: Push to Hugging Face Spaces
1. Run `python upload_to_hf.py` to push the clean payload to the Hugging Face remote.
2. Verify that the build starts successfully in the Hugging Face Space.
