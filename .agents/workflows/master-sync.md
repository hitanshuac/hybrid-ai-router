# Master Sync Workflow

<workflow_steps>
1. Invoke the **Update Docs Workflow** to ensure all `.md` files are strictly synced with the latest Python and SQL codebase.
2. Invoke the **Publish Showcase Workflow** to generate the final Mermaid architecture diagram, generate a versioned image directly from that Mermaid diagram, and prepare the `README.md` for the showcase.
3. Invoke the **Secure Checkpoint Workflow** to securely commit and push the updated codebase, images, and documentation to GitHub.
